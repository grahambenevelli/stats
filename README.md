# Football stats server

### TODO list

* Extract the nfl api classes
* Reimplement the ETL steps
* Combine game stats steps so we only have one call
* Get drive stats
* Get player draft info
* Get games from the site and not a file
* Test against the N most similar players (using Pearson and Euclidean)
* Get player age
* Convert to query DSL
* Fill out actual README :)
